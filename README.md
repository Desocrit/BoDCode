C# code for the BoD project. For copyright reasons, 
I cannot post the full files for this game, so this repository will, only include the C# script files, and a small playable demo.
To run, download and run the included .exe file.

How to Play

Standard WASD controls affect movement. Q and E while perform dodges, while Control performs a slide. A fireball attack can be cast with the left mouse button, and a freeze attack can be cast with the right mouse button. Collecting four gems will activate the level exit. Note that the core systems are still being worked on, so gameplay is relatively limited.
